### Introduction

The _Talisker Foundation Toolkit_, or "FoundationKit" for short, is a portable collection of basic COM interfaces and foundational classes.

### Get the Foundation Toolkit

#### Installing binary packages

There are currently no binary packages of the Foundation Toolkit available. This is expected to change as the project matures.

To use Foundation Toolkit, you must  instead [clone the repository](#cloning-the-repository) and [build from source](#building-from-source).

#### Building from a distribution tarball

There are currently no distribution tarballs of the Foundation Toolkit available. This is expected to change as the project matures.

To use Foundation Toolkit, you must instead [clone the repository](#cloning-the-repository) and [build from source](#building-from-source).

#### Cloning this repository

If there are no suitable binary packages or distribution tarballs available, or if you just wish to try out the latest bleeding-edge development version of the Foundation Toolkit, you can clone the [source repository](https://github.com/TaliskerPlatform/FoundationKit.framework) and build that instead.

First, clone the repository itself:

```
$ git clone --branch=develop https://github.com/TaliskerPlatform/FoundationKit.framework.git FoundationKit
Cloning into 'FoundationKit'...
remote: Counting objects: 225, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (126/126), done.
remote: Total 225 (delta 117), reused 181 (delta 75), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (225/225), 56.80 KiB | 653.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (117/117), done.
```

Now, change into the `FoundationKit` directory and fetch the _sub-modules_:

```
$ cd FoundationKit
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
Submodule 'ThirdParty/uriparser' (git://github.com/uriparser/uriparser.git) registered for path 'ThirdParty/uriparser'
Submodule 'ThirdParty/uthash' (git://github.com/troydhanson/uthash.git) registered for path 'ThirdParty/uthash'
...
$
```

Now that you've cloned the repository and its sub-modules, you can either proceed to [building the tree from source directly](#building-from-source). Alternatively, if you have [Docker](https://docker.com) for Mac or Linux installed, you can [perform builds with Docker](#building-with-docker).

### Building from source

**Note**: You can use [Docker](https://docker.com) to orchestrate your build process if you prefer; see the _[Building with Docker](#building-with-docker)_ section, below, for further information.

#### Preparing the source tree

If you have [cloned this repository](#cloning-this-repository), you will need to prepare it for building from source using `autoreconf`. You will need to re-run `autoreconf` when you fetch upstream changes which modify the build logic (`configure.ac`, any `Makefile.am` files, etc.).

You should skip this step if you obtained the sources from a distribution tarball.

Change to the directory that you cloned `FoundationKit` into:

```
$ autoreconf -fvi
autoreconf: Entering directory `.'
autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gettext
...
$
```

The options passed to `autoreconf` here are:

* `-v`: be verbose; you can omit this if you wish
* `-i`: install; copy missing build scripts into the source tree from the versions supplied with `autoconf`/`automake`, etc.
* `-f`: force; updates build scripts with the versions installed on your local system


#### Configuration

Next, you can use `configure` and `make` as you would any other Autotools-based project:

```
$ ./configure [STANDARD CONFIGURE OPTIONS]
...
```

e.g.:

```
$ ./configure --prefix=/opt/talisker
```

#### Building

Once configured successfully, you can build the Foundation Toolkit:
```
$ make
...
```

The `make check` target is used to run automated tests:

```
$ make check
...
```

#### Installation

As is conventional, you can use `make install` to install the Foundation Toolkit onto your system:

```
$ sudo make install
Password:
...
```

On Darwin-based systems (macOS, iOS, tvOS and watchOS), Foundation Toolkit will be installed as `/Library/Frameworks/FoundationKit.framework` and can be used via `-framework FoundationKit`.

On other systems, Foundation Toolkit is installed to `${libdir}` and `${includedir}` and can be used via `-lFoundationKit`.

### Building with Docker

**Note:** For instructions on building from source _without_ Docker, see the _[Building from source](#building-from-source)_ section, above, for further information.

Once you have [cloned this repository](#cloning-this-repository), you can run the following:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build
FoundationKit Docker build tool

Usage (from top of FoundationKit source tree):
  Resources/Docker/build all       Build for all targets
  Resources/Docker/build clean     Remove build files
  Resources/Docker/build prepare   Ensure base images exist
  Resources/Docker/build update    Update base images
  Resources/Docker/build list      List available targets
  Resources/Docker/build TARGET    Build for TARGET

Available targets:
  jessie
  precise
  stretch
  trusty
  wheezy
  xenial
```

You can build for a single target by specifying its name:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build jessie
...
```

Or you can build for each of the targets in turn:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build all
...
```

The `prepare` operand creates base images for each of the targets (whose `Dockerfile`s can be found in
[`Resources/Docker/*`](Resources/Docker)), and is invoked automatically as part of a build, but you can run it manually
if you wish:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build prepare
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:centos7... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:jessie... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:precise... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:stretch... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:trusty... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:wheezy... found
checking for Docker image foundationkit-base:xenial... found
```

If you want to update your base images, you can use:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build update
...
```

Alternatively, you can update a single base image:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build update-jessie
building Docker image foundationkit-base:jessie...
Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.048kB
Step 1/7 : FROM debian:jessie
... 
```

While in use, `Resources/Docker/build` will create and use a `DockerBuild` directory. You can remove this with:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build clean
```

Alternatively, you can remove it yourself at any time a Docker build is not in progress.
