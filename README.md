## Foundation Toolkit

**This is currently pre-alpha quality code. All interfaces ought to be considered unstable.**

### Building with Docker

Once you have cloned this repository, you can run the following:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build
FoundationKit Docker build tool

Usage (from top of FoundationKit source tree):
  Resources/Docker/build all       Build for all targets
  Resources/Docker/build clean     Remove build files
  Resources/Docker/build prepare   Ensure base images exist
  Resources/Docker/build update    Update base images
  Resources/Docker/build list      List available targets
  Resources/Docker/build TARGET    Build for TARGET

Available targets:
  jessie
  precise
  stretch
  trusty
  wheezy
  xenial
```

You can build for a single target by specifying its name:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build jessie
```

Or you can build for each of the targets in turn:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build all
```

The `prepare` operand creates base images for each of the targets (whose `Dockerfile`s can be found in
[`Resources/Docker/*`](Resources/Docker)), and is invoked automatically as part of a build, but you can run it manually
if you wish. If you want to update your base images, you can use:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build update
```

While building, `Resources/Docker/build` will create and use a `DockerBuild` directory. You can remove this with:

```
$ Resources/Docker/build clean
```

Alternatively, you can remove it yourself at any time a Docker build is not in progress.
